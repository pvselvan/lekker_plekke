# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   cities = City.create([{ name: 'Chicago' }, { name: 'Copenhagen' }])
#   Mayor.create(name: 'Emanuel', city: cities.first)


# Place.delete_all <- use this so you don't get duplicates 
# Place.create! name: "Table Mountain", address: "123 Meep St"
# Place.create! mame: "Lion's Head", address: "56 Hai Rd"
